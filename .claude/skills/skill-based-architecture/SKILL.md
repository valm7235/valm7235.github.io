# Skill-Based Architecture

Restructure oversized single-file Skills or scattered project rules into a well-organized Skill directory. Builds on the official minimal Agent Skill contract (`name` + `description`) and kicks in when a single small `SKILL.md` is no longer enough.

## When to Use

- A single SKILL.md exceeds ~150 lines, mixing rules, workflows, and background material
- Project rules are scattered across `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, etc.
- User explicitly requests Skill-based architecture or rule consolidation

## When NOT to Use

- Very small projects (fewer than 3 rule/doc files)
- Temporary repos with no long-term maintenance needs
- Teams with a well-functioning documentation system who don't want to migrate

## Progressive Rigor

Grow only under pressure. Tiers: **Single-file** (`SKILL.md` only, < 3 topics) → **Folder-light** (`+ rules/`, 3–5 topics or 1 recurring workflow) → **Full** (`+ workflows/` + `references/` + thin shells; ≥ 3 routed tasks, gotcha log, or multi-harness repo). Upgrade triggers: SKILL.md > 100 lines, same pitfall surfaces twice, a task needs step-by-step instructions, or two harnesses share routing. Downgrade when content shrinks. Details: [references/layout.md § Progressive Rigor](references/layout.md#progressive-rigor).

## Target Structure

```text
skills/<name>/
├── SKILL.md          # ≤100 lines: always-read list, task routing, priority
├── rules/            # Long-lived constraints (what is always true)
├── workflows/        # Step-by-step procedures (how to do a task)
├── references/       # Background: architecture, pitfalls, indexes
│   └── gotchas.md    # Recommended: known gotchas / footguns (most valuable reference)
└── docs/             # Optional: prompts, reports, external-facing material
```

Root entries (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CODEX.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.codex/`) → thin shells with inline routing tables.
`.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → Cursor registration entry (required for discovery). See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for templates.

## Core Principles

1. **Single concise entry** — `SKILL.md` ≤ 100 lines; it navigates, not exhausts. ✓ Check: `wc -l` ≤ 100; over → move content to sub-files.
2. **One skill folder** — all formal docs under `skills/<name>/`, not scattered at repo root. ✓ Check: `ls *.md` at root shows only thin shells, not rule/workflow files.
3. **Rules ≠ Flows** — `rules/` for constraints, `workflows/` for procedures. ✓ Check: any numbered steps in `rules/`? Any "always/never" in `workflows/`? Either = mixing.
4. **Thin shells with inline routing** — every harness entry embeds a routing table (task → reads → workflow). ✓ Check: open any shell — 3-column table within first 40 lines? No → soft pointer.
5. **Cursor registration entry** — `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` must exist. ✓ Check: `ls .cursor/skills/` — missing = Cursor cannot discover the skill.
6. **Progressive Rigor** — three tiers (Single-file / Folder-light / Full); grow only under pressure — see [Progressive Rigor section above](#progressive-rigor) + [details](references/layout.md#progressive-rigor). ✓ Check: can you name the specific pressure that forced the current tier? "It felt right" ≠ pressure.
7. **Description = trigger condition** — write description with explicit quoted phrases, not passive summary ([ref](references/layout.md#description-as-trigger-condition)). ✓ Check: ≥ 2 quoted phrases + "Activate when…"? No → rewrite.
8. **Gotchas are highest-value** — maintain costly pitfalls actively; keep them discoverable. ✓ Check: is each high-cost gotcha reachable from a Common Tasks route, not only buried in `references/`?
9. **Progressive disclosure** — SKILL.md links one level deep; deep content pulled only when task-routed. ✓ Check: open SKILL.md and follow every link — does any target file link further to a third level that should have been reachable from SKILL.md directly? If yes, SKILL.md is hiding its routing structure.
10. **Task Closure Protocol** — AAR is part of completion, not optional ([ref](TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md#task-closure-protocol)); "behavior change" covers interaction, schema/renderer, styling, overlay/z-index, and host-compat too, not only business logic or data flow. ✓ Check: all 4 AAR questions answered before marking done? Skipped "nothing to record" genuinely true?
11. **Generalization rule** — records must make sense outside current project context ([ref](TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md#generalization-rule)). ✓ Check: replace project name with a different one — still makes sense? No → rewrite as pattern.
12. **Self-maintenance** — line counts signal evaluation, not automatic action. ✓ Check before splitting: topics independently navigable? Reader ever wants only one part? Both yes → split.
13. **Activation over storage** — pitfall in `references/` alone is not "captured"; must also be on the task path. ✓ Check: trace normal route for this scenario — Agent hits the entry without hunting? No → stored, not activated.
14. **Token efficiency** — Always-read stays 2–3 files; domain files via Common Tasks only. ✓ Check: Always Read > 3 entries? Demote lowest-frequency.
15. **Rationalizations Table** — captures verbatim excuses from real pressure-test failures ([ref](TEMPLATES-GUIDE.md#rationalizations-to-reject), [Phase 9](WORKFLOW.md#phase-9-pressure-test-the-skill)). ✓ Check: every row traces to a real failure — speculative rows dilute pressure value; remove them.
16. **Response discipline** — output short, precise, direct answers; avoid process narration, self-congratulation, gratuitous confirmations, and requirement restatement. Correct objective errors neutrally; do not infer user stance. ✓ Check: does each sentence serve the explicit request? No → delete it.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing Cursor registration entry** — Formal skill at `skills/<name>/` but no `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` → Cursor never discovers the skill; all rules/workflows silently ignored
2. **Soft-pointer-only shell** — Thin shell says "go read SKILL.md" without an inline routing table → instruction lost after context summarization in long conversations
3. **Vague description** — Description written as passive summary instead of trigger conditions with quoted phrases → skill exists but Agent never activates it (see [references/layout.md § Description as Trigger Condition](references/layout.md#description-as-trigger-condition))
4. **Stored but not activated** — Costly pitfall recorded in `references/` but not surfaced in any workflow checklist or SKILL.md routing → future agents still miss it
5. **Task Closure Protocol skipped** — Agent considers itself "done" after main work, skips the 30-second AAR scan → lessons not captured; use Task Closure Protocol to make AAR a completion gate, not an optional add-on
6. **Project-specific records** — Lessons written as project narratives ("in our product module, we found…") instead of reusable knowledge → useless outside current context; apply generalization rule before recording
7. **No SessionStart hook on long sessions** — `/clear` or `/compact` silently drops SKILL.md from context; agent loses all routing and protocol awareness without the user noticing → install SessionStart hook if your harness supports it (see [references/thin-shells.md § SessionStart Hook](references/thin-shells.md#sessionstart-hook-optional))
8. **Route skipping in multi-task sessions** — Agent reads SKILL.md for the first task, then skips re-reading for subsequent tasks in the same session ("I already know the rules"). New tasks may match different routes; context may have been compressed. Result: agent works from partial/stale memory, misses critical rules, debugs in wrong direction for hours → SKILL.md template now includes Session Discipline section; all shells include re-read trigger

## Content Classification

| Content type | Target |
|---|---|
| Stable constraints, must-follow rules | `rules/` |
| Step-by-step task procedures | `workflows/` |
| Architecture, pitfalls, source indexes | `references/` |
| Known gotchas, footguns, edge cases | `references/gotchas.md` (or domain-specific pitfall files) |
| Prompts, reports, external docs | `docs/` |
| Editor/tool-specific config | `.cursor/` / `.claude/` (thin shells) |
