# autoskills

**One command. Your entire AI skill stack. Installed.**

[autoskills.sh](https://autoskills.sh)

</div>

Scans your project, detects your tech stack, and installs curated AI agent skills automatically.

```bash
npx autoskills
```

## How it works

1. Run `npx autoskills` in your project root
2. Your `package.json`, Gradle files, and config files are scanned to detect technologies
3. The best matching AI agent skills are selected from the audited autoskills registry
4. Only the selected skill files are downloaded from the registry and verified before writing them locally

That's it. No config needed.

## Security model

`autoskills` does not install directly from random upstream repositories at runtime.

Skills are synced by maintainers into the repository-local autoskills registry, scanned for prompt-injection and supply-chain risks, and recorded with SHA-256 hashes in a manifest. When you run `autoskills`, the CLI downloads only the skills your project needs from that curated registry, verifies every file against the manifest, and writes a `skills-lock.json` entry with the installed source and bundle hash.

This keeps the package small while avoiding live downloads from third-party skill sources during installation.

## Options

```
-y, --yes       Skip confirmation prompt
--dry-run       Show what would be installed without installing
-h, --help      Show help message
```
